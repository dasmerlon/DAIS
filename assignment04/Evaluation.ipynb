    "## Model Evaluation\n",
    "In this task, we will take a look at the evaluation of a classifier. As a starting point, we give you some functions that allow you to train a classifier with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). PyTorch is a bit more advanced than scikit-learn and needs you to do more of the busy work yourself.\n",
    "On the other hand, it gives you the freedom to manually create your own training schemes and network configurations. Together with [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), it is the de facto industry standard when it comes to neural network training.\n",
    "For this task, it's not really necessary to understand the PyTorch code. But if you're interested in learning PyTorch, try to follow along by reading the comments. Don't worry if you don't understand everything. Just be aware that for our purpose `torch.tensor` behaves mostly like `numpy.array` which you should be familiar with by now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A great opportunity to learn more is the [tutorial section of the PyTorch homepage](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) which provides many tutorials on different machine learning tasks. If you want to find information on a given function, take a look at the [documentation section](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)."
